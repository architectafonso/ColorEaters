/**
 * Created by Jo√£o on 17/08/2015.
 * Has the method to return the level's String[] that is then used by LevelLoader to create the
 * necessary board.
 * Each level package has a method called getLevel( int level) that returns a string[] with this format:
 * 6 strings of 6 characters and another with the number of moves.
 * Characters used right now:
 * b, B - blue cake and eater;
 * g, G - green cake and eater;
 * w, W - white cake and eater;
 * r, R - red cake and eater;
 * y, Y - yellow cake and eater;
 * X - blocking X piece.
 *
 * Use LevelLoader.loadLevel to actually get an board with the level loaded.
