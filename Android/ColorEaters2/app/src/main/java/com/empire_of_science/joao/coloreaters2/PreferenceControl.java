/**
 * Created by JoÃ£o on 10/10/2016.
 *
 * This class contains the methods to read and write to preferences.
 *
 * There are the following shared preferences:
 *
 * Strings with name "1", "2" and so on, that are the levels packages solving history.
 * This strings have 20 characters, that are n for unsolved levels and y for solved levels.
 * To check if level 3 of package 4 was solved, get string named "4" from preferences and
 * check the char at index 2 (the third one).
 *
 * Booleans "sound" and "animation", should be true if sound or animations are turned on.
 *
 * Make sure to always call a method to get a value from preferences as those also create the
 * preference if it doesn't exist.
